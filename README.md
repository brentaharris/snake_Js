Snake game coded in JavaScript by Brent. <br>
Free to use how you want!<br>
Control the snake (colored in blue) with the keyboard arrow keys, up, down, left, or right. Your goal is to consume the yellow colored food (by contacting the 'head' of the snake with the food). Each time the food is consumed, the food will randomly re-spawn on the game board, and your snake will grow in length by one.<br>
Watch out! Do not run the snake into itself or the edges of the gameboard or you will lose!<br>
Difficulty:<br>
Easy - snake speed is slow.<br>
Harder - snake speed is faster.<br>
Hardest - snake speed is VERY FAST.<br>
Have fun!
